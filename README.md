# Zoom Clone

### How To Run

1. In your CLI, git clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Elliott-Chong/tech4good.git

2. Next, cd into the directory

   ```
   cd tech4good
   ```

3. Afterwards, install the node packages needed

   ```
   npm i
   ```

4. As we are using WebRTC [Peer JS], we will need to install the peer.js library globally

   ```
   npm i -g peer
   ```

5. To start the peer js server, we will be using port 3001 as the peer js port

   ```
   peerjs --port 3001
   ```

6. To start the project, open a new terminal and we will be using port 8081 as the port for the web server

   ```
   npm start
   ```

7. Congratulations! You have successfully created the server to visit the site go to [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)
